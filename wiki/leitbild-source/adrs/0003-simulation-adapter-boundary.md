# ADR 0003: Simulation Adapter Boundary

## Decision

Leitbild talks to simulations through stable `SimulationConnection` interfaces coordinated by a Simulation Hub when a Control Instance has multiple providers.

V1 includes local in-process ambulance and traffic simulator adapters, but the adapter contract is remote-capable and suitable for a future WebSocket adapter.

The Control Instance Projected State is the canonical current Leitbild truth. The Durable Journal records meaningful accepted history. Simulation instances are providers connected to a Control Instance. They may keep private state or provider-local projections for their own mechanics, but they do not own canonical Leitbild object state.

## Rationale

Simulation providers own specialist mechanics such as motion stepping, route following, sensor generation, scenario timing, or private high-resolution models. Leitbild owns control instances, actors, command envelopes, canonical state projection, UI, the Durable Journal, replay of meaningful decisions, API reads, metrics instrumentation, and cross-provider interaction commit.

Domain rules may be local to one provider or may require interaction across providers. Cross-object and cross-simulation interaction is coordinated through Control Instance interaction signals and handlers, not by one provider mutating another provider.

Objects may be the source or subject of domain events, but objects do not emit directly onto Leitbild's event stream. Simulation instances emit `SimulationEvent`s and interaction signals through the adapter with explicit provenance. Leitbild orders accepted domain events in the Control Instance runtime, applies them to Projected State, broadcasts them through the Live Change Feed, and persists durable ones to the Durable Journal.

After events are committed, simulation providers may observe committed events to update private state or provider-local projections. This observation is not a second canonical mutation path.

## Consequences

- The browser never talks directly to the simulator.
- Local simulators must use the same adapter boundary as remote simulators.
- Multiple providers in one Control Instance must be coordinated through the Simulation Hub, not merged into one domain provider.
- Providers declare accepted command kinds so commands can be routed explicitly.
- Commands have explicit issued, accepted, and rejected lifecycle events.
- Canonical current object state for UI, API, metrics, and AI agents comes from Control Instance Projected State.
- Simulation providers may maintain private state, but must treat committed Control Instance events as the shared operational picture.
- Cross-provider interaction logic lives in registered interaction handlers, usually contributed by packs.
- Leitbild core owns signal/effect envelopes and commit semantics, but should not implement ambulance, drone, ship, robotaxi, or hospital-specific world rules.
- Event ordering for shared Leitbild state is owned by the Control Instance runtime.
- Provider-local event ordering may exist internally, but it is not authoritative for shared Leitbild state until emitted and committed.
