# ADR 0018: Process Plant Signal Bindings And Control/Protection Substrate

## Status

Accepted.

## Context

Process-plant scenarios need to support operators, AI agents, procedures, alarms, trips, and future control-room surfaces. The same internal plant value may be referenced in several ways:

- as a compiled runtime variable path, such as `pressurizer.pressureMPa`
- as a procedure-facing tag, such as `PT-455`
- as a URI-like external reference, such as `process-plant://unit-1/pressurizer.pressureMPa`
- as an equipment-associated signal for display and documentation

The Samsinn PWR operations wiki already uses procedure tags and simulator bindings. Leitbild needs a clean equivalent without introducing a separate binding catalog that can drift from the graph, without making assumptions about fleets of identical units, and without turning process physics into event messages.

## Decision

Process signal identity is graph-owned metadata compiled into each process system.

The source of truth for a process signal is the compiled variable:

```text
{ controlRunId, systemId, variablePath }
```

`systemId` is always explicit. There is no implicit current unit, fleet-wide alias, or shared cross-unit namespace. Multi-unit scenarios are represented as multiple independent process systems.

Component and link variable descriptors may declare:

- `tagId`: a procedure/operator-facing signal identifier such as `PT-455`
- `equipmentId`: the equipment or component reference associated with the signal
- `description`: a concise human/agent description
- `externalRefs`: optional stable external references, including `process-plant://{systemId}/{variablePath}` when useful
- `capabilities`: optional operational visibility metadata when the derived defaults are insufficient
- `limits`: optional normal, operating, hard, and alarm ranges

`tagId` is unique only within one compiled process system. The same tag can exist in another system because API calls include `systemId`.

The previous `sensorId` and `actuatorId` split is rejected. A signal is one identity. Whether it can be written is determined by the variable descriptor's `writable` flag.

Capabilities are compiled from `writable`, `publish`, and `tagId` by default. Explicit capability overrides are allowed only on graph metadata and should be used sparingly. The compiler rejects tagged variables that are made invisible to operators, AI agents, and procedures.

Limits have two roles. `hardRange` is enforced during runtime writes and restore validation. `normalRange`, `operatingRange`, and `alarmLimits` are interpretation metadata for procedure reasoning, UI presentation, and future alarm/protection rule authoring.

The process-plant compiler builds a signal index from graph variables:

- by variable path
- by `tagId`
- searchable by text, tag, equipment, quantity, domain, writable flag, and publication policy
- carrying compiled capabilities and limits

No separate binding table is introduced in V1.

The pack query/API surface resolves tags directly:

```json
{
  "packId": "process-plant",
  "kind": "process-plant.signals.read",
  "payload": {
    "systemId": "unit-1",
    "signals": [{ "tagId": "PT-455" }]
  }
}
```

Commands use the same explicit signal reference shape:

```json
{
  "kind": "process-plant.control.write",
  "payload": {
    "systemId": "unit-1",
    "tagId": "PORV-456A",
    "value": 1
  }
}
```

Exactly one of `path` or `tagId` must be supplied. Unknown or non-writable signals fail explicitly.

Control/protection logic is pack-owned and deterministic. It is Leitbild's simplified process-plant I&C substrate, not a second physics solver and not an embedded emergency procedure engine. It reads process variable snapshots through signal bindings, evaluates typed declarative logic, queues validated writes for the next solver tick, and emits interaction signals for alarm/trip transitions. It does not mutate continuous physics through the event bus.

The substrate is layered:

1. **Instrumentation signals**: resolved process variables used as indications, controller inputs, alarm inputs, procedure inputs, and AI-visible observations.
2. **Normal controllers**: routine automatic control behavior such as level, pressure, flow, pump speed, valve position, turbine/load, or heater/spray control. Controllers may request writes only through the validated queued-write path.
3. **Protection functions**: safety-like automatic behavior such as reactor trip, isolation, relief, engineered safeguard actuation, or equipment trip. Protection functions may latch and may have reset requirements, but they still use the same signal reference and write machinery.
4. **Alarm/annunciator state**: persistent operator/AI-facing current state plus transition events. Alarms can be active, acknowledged, cleared, latched, resettable, or suppressed. Structured annunciator metadata carries stable system, equipment, group, priority, role, and first-out grouping so UI/AI consumers do not infer those semantics from message text. Acknowledgement records that a human or agent has seen the alarm; it does not by itself make the condition false.
5. **Permissives and interlocks**: command/action constraints. A permissive must be true before an action may proceed. An interlock prevents, forces, or constrains an equipment state. Both are I&C semantics above physics, not hidden component behavior.
6. **Validated actions**: constrained effects such as alarm state transitions, trip state transitions, and queued writes to process signals.

External procedures remain outside the process-plant pack for now. A procedure runner, human operator, or AI agent can ask "what is this signal value?" and "is this named condition true?", then issue a command through the normal command path. The process-plant pack exposes the facts and condition evaluation surface needed for procedures, but it does not own the procedure document, procedure branching state, or human/AI procedure execution policy.

The implemented V1 I&C rule language supports only typed primitives:

- variable comparison/equality
- `all`, `any`, `not`, and voting conditions
- optional `modeCondition` and `modeLabel` for state-qualified rules. This deliberately reuses the same condition language rather than adding a global mode store.
- delay and latch behavior
- reset conditions
- effects: `alarm.enter`, `trip.enter`, and `writeSignal`
- command gates for permissives and interlocks

Arbitrary expressions, user-authored code, and hidden procedure engines are out of scope for V1.

The runtime now performs semantic validation before a process system starts. `alarm` rules may only emit alarm lifecycle effects. `normalControl` rules may only request validated writes. `protection` rules may only emit trip lifecycle effects and/or request validated writes. `permissive` and `interlock` rules must use `commandGates` and must not emit lifecycle effects. This keeps the I&C vocabulary small but real, and prevents a rule from pretending to be one kind of automation while behaving like another.

Command gates use the same signal-reference shape as reads and writes. A permissive gate must evaluate true before the target write is accepted. An interlock gate blocks the target write when its condition evaluates true. Gates apply to external operator, AI, scenario, and internal I&C write requests through the same queued write path; there is no privileged bypass. Gate conditions are evaluated against the current fixed-step runtime snapshot, not against un-applied queued commands.

Definitions may be provided by graphRef defaults, process-system configuration, or scenario provider configuration. Reusable graphRefs may ship default I&C definitions for their plant model; a scenario may enable, disable, add, or parameterize rules for one explicit `systemId`. There is no fleet-wide I&C definition and no cross-system defaulting.

The first reference I&C definition is explicit, not automatic: `icRef: "process-plant.pressurized-water-reactor.ic.v1"` in one process system's provider config. The reference behavior is plant automation and annunciation only. It may energize simple automatic controls, actuate protection-like reference functions, emit alarm/trip lifecycle state, and expose condition truth. It must not encode emergency procedures, diagnosis trees, operator instructions, or external procedure branch state.

For V1, `icRef` and inline `protection` are mutually exclusive for one system. The pack rejects both together so scenarios cannot accidentally rely on hidden merge order.

## Runtime Ordering

Each provider tick uses this order:

1. Apply queued external/control writes at the runtime phase boundary.
2. Run deterministic solver phases.
3. Evaluate control/protection rules against the completed tick snapshot.
4. Queue any rule writes for the next solver tick.
5. Emit alarm/trip interaction signals for state transitions.
6. Record telemetry/read-only trend samples.

This keeps continuous physics single-sourced in the variable table and prevents mid-solver mutation.

Automatic actions from normal controllers and protection functions intentionally share the same validation path as operator, scenario, and AI writes. The actor may be internal, such as `actor:process-plant-protection`, but the effect still resolves a signal, checks writability, validates type and hard limits, and enters the next tick through the runtime write queue. This avoids a privileged mutation path that can disagree with operator/API semantics.

## Implemented Surface

Pack queries:

- `process-plant.signals.resolve`
- `process-plant.signals.read`
- `process-plant.signals.search`
- `process-plant.conditions.evaluate`
- `process-plant.procedure-tags.validate`
- `process-plant.control.validate`
- `process-plant.ic.status`
- `process-plant.ic.catalog`
- `process-plant.alarms.status`
- `process-plant.alarms.summary`
- `process-plant.alarms.history`

Pack commands:

- `process-plant.control.write`
- `process-plant.ic.lifecycle`

`process-plant.conditions.evaluate` accepts one explicit `systemId` and a typed condition. It returns `matches` plus the full list of signal reads used during evaluation, including compound condition children. This makes external procedure/AI reasoning inspectable without letting process-plant execute the procedure itself.

`process-plant.procedure-tags.validate` accepts extracted procedure tag appendix rows and resolves them against the same graph-owned signal bindings. It reports missing tags and metadata mismatches for optional `simPath`, `units`, and `equipment` fields. It does not parse procedure documents, decide procedure branches, or create a second simulator-binding table.

`process-plant.control.validate` accepts the same payload shape as `process-plant.control.write` and dry-runs the same validation path: signal resolution, writable-signal check, type and hard-range validation, and permissive/interlock evaluation. It is read-only and exists so operator surfaces, scenario tooling, and AI agents can explain whether an action is currently allowed before issuing it.

`process-plant.ic.catalog` exposes configured rule metadata for one explicit process system: rule class, mode label, watched signals, write effects, command gates, and annunciator metadata. It is an inspection surface, not an execution path.

`process-plant.ic.lifecycle` accepts one explicit lifecycle action for one alarm/trip lifecycle id. Lifecycle actions affect acknowledgement, reset, suppression, and shelving state only; they do not alter process variables and do not execute procedure logic. The payload may include operator/client provenance such as `reason` and may include `shelveDurationMs` for time-bounded shelving.

`process-plant.ic.status` returns current rule, alarm, trip, and failure state for one explicit process system. Alarm/trip state includes active, acknowledged, latched, suppressed, shelved, resettable, phase, first-out, transition timestamps, and transition counts. Acknowledgement is an explicit command and never clears the underlying condition.

`process-plant.alarms.status`, `process-plant.alarms.summary`, and `process-plant.alarms.history` are alarm-board and AI-monitor views over the same pack-owned lifecycle state. They expose current alarms/trips, grouped summary counts, first-out entries, and bounded transition history with actor/client/reason provenance. They do not create a second alarm state store.

## Consequences

- AI agents can resolve procedure tags directly through the process-plant pack query surface.
- Procedure bindings live with the graph that defines the plant; they cannot silently diverge into a side table.
- `tagId` is readable and compact for operators, while `variablePath` remains stable and code-friendly.
- Multi-unit scenarios stay simple: every read/write includes `systemId`.
- Writable controls and read-only indications use the same signal shape and differ only by `writable`.
- Control/protection behavior is deterministic, replayable, and testable without adding a general scripting engine.
- Interaction signals are used for alarms/trips and operator-facing notifications, not for continuous physics.
- The same substrate can support future process-control surfaces, alarm boards, AI monitors, and external procedure runners without making those systems rewrite plant physics.
- The distinction between normal control, protection, alarm, permissive, and interlock gives future code a vocabulary for behavior without hardcoding plant-specific assumptions.

## Guardrails

- Do not reintroduce `sensorId` or `actuatorId`.
- Do not add a separate binding catalog unless graph-owned signal metadata hits a documented limitation.
- Do not allow tag lookup without explicit `systemId`.
- Do not add unit-context aliases, fleet-level shortcuts, or cross-unit defaulting.
- Do not make procedure tags globally unique across independent process systems.
- Do not let control/protection rules write variables directly during a solver phase.
- Do not add arbitrary expression evaluation, JavaScript snippets, or generated runtime code to scenario-authored protection rules.
- Do not hide API failures behind fallbacks from tag to path or path to tag.
- Do not embed emergency procedure execution, procedure branching state, or procedure document parsing inside process-plant without a new ADR.
- Do not turn reference I&C behavior into a second procedure system. Procedure documents and procedure execution remain external.
- Do not model normal controllers, protection functions, alarms, permissives, and interlocks as unrelated mechanisms. They are one I&C substrate with distinct semantics.
- Do not model alarms only as transient events. Current alarm state is authoritative pack-owned state and transition events are history.
- Do not add fleet-wide protection, alarm, or condition state. Every I&C definition and state belongs to one explicit process system.
