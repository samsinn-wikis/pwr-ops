# Object Context, Scenarios, and Missions

This document defines Leitbild's extended object data model and the first scenario/mission vocabulary.

## Goals

- Keep `OperationalObject` as the canonical envelope for map-based control-center work.
- Keep `domainData` as domain-specific operational truth validated by the active domain pack.
- Add `context` as a perspective-bearing awareness layer for assets, operators, system processes, and AI agents.
- Separate scenario initialization from mission intent, objectives, tasking, and progression.
- Keep the v1 model JSON-friendly, Zod-validated, and suitable for later LLM-derived views without making LLM prompts canonical state.

## Rationale

Leitbild needs objects that are useful to humans, simulators, and AI agents. A hospital, ambulance, drone, ship, robotaxi, or incident all need current operational state, but agents also need a concise representation of what the object knows, has observed, has been told, and may need to remember.

This must not become one untyped blob. Simulation truth, operational domain state, and object perspective have different lifecycles and failure modes:

- **Operational truth** must remain replayable, validated, and suitable for UI/map rendering.
- **Perspective** may be incomplete, stale, uncertain, or actor-specific.
- **Agent views** should be derived from canonical state and context, not persisted as another source of truth.

## Sources Considered

- **MSDL / C2SIM-style separation**: military simulation standards separate initial scenario state from orders, reports, and ongoing tasking. Leitbild follows that split: scenario initializes the world; mission describes operational intent and progression. Reference: [NETN MSDL initialization](https://netn.mscoe.org/netn-modules/msdl).
- **Miltech Mission Hub**: uses mission settings, map objects, routes, objectives, triggers, activities, activation, and connections. Its activation discipline is important: later-stage objectives and triggers should not all be active from the start. References: [objectives, triggers, and activities](https://docs.miltechsimulations.com/miltech-mission-hub/guides/building-detailed-missions-objectives-triggers-and-activities), [map objects](https://docs.miltechsimulations.com/miltech-mission-hub/detailed-documentation/map-objects).
- **Microsoft Flight Simulator mission XML**: uses mission definitions, objectives, flow states, event triggers, and actions. This supports the staged mission-flow idea but also warns against overfitting to a flight-specific XML model. References: [mission definitions](https://docs.flightsimulator.com/html/Content_Configuration/Flights_And_Missions/Mission_Definitions.htm), [flow states](https://docs.flightsimulator.com/html/Content_Configuration/Flights_And_Missions/Mission_Elements/FlowStateAction.htm), [event triggers](https://docs.flightsimulator.com/html/Content_Configuration/Flights_And_Missions/Event_Trigger_Definitions.htm).
- **DCS-style mission editors**: trigger/action systems are powerful but can become brittle, hard to inspect, and difficult to test when many triggers are globally active. Leitbild v1 should use a small declarative trigger/action vocabulary, not a general scripting engine. Reference: [DCS trigger basics](https://wiki.hoggit.us/view/DCS_editor_triggerBasics).

## Terminology

**Operational Object**:
The canonical Leitbild object envelope. It contains identity, kind, domain, spatial state, operational state, tasking, telemetry, alerts, provenance, timestamps, optional domain data, and optional context.

**Domain Data**:
Domain-specific operational truth for an object. Domain packs own the schema and validation. Examples: ambulance crew/capabilities, incident victims/hazards, hospital emergency capacity.

**Object Context**:
Perspective-bearing artificial situation awareness attached to an operational object. Context captures what an asset, operator, system, or AI perspective knows, remembers, observed, or was told.

**Scenario Definition**:
Validated startup definition for a new control instance: world settings, active packs, optional provider overrides/configuration, initial objects, and initial contexts.

**Mission Definition**:
Operational intent layered on top of a scenario: goals, objectives, tasks, stages, triggers, actions, and evaluation metrics.

**Mission Progress State**:
Runtime execution state for a mission definition: active stages, objective/task statuses, fired triggers, and timing. It is not the mission definition itself.

**Agent Context View**:
A bounded, derived, LLM-friendly view assembled from object state, context, mission/task state, and relevant nearby objects. It is not persisted as canonical state.

## Data Model Boundaries

### `domainData` vs `context`

`domainData` answers: "What is true enough for this domain's operational model?"

`context` answers: "What does this perspective know or remember about itself and the situation?"

Examples:

- Ambulance `domainData`: ALS capability, crew level, available seats.
- Ambulance `context`: recent dispatch radio call, last route deviation note, knowledge that Incident 77 may have two victims.
- Hospital `domainData`: current ambulance bay availability and diversion status.
- Hospital `context`: note that the ER charge nurse reported a possible capacity reduction five minutes ago.

### Truth vs Perspective

Leitbild supports both:

- Truth/reference state lives in canonical object fields and pack-validated `domainData`.
- Perspective-bearing awareness lives in `context`.
- Every context fact/activity must carry source, perspective, and time.

This allows uncertainty, stale information, asymmetric knowledge, simulated communication delay, and AI-agent reasoning without corrupting the canonical operational state.

## Object Context V1

`ObjectContext` is intentionally small:

- `schemaVersion`: currently `1`.
- `facts`: structured knowledge entries.
- `activity`: bounded recent memory/log entries.
- `references`: ids of relevant objects, tasks, messages, or external resources.
- `summaries`: compact summaries of older or grouped activity.

Context facts reuse the existing `KnowledgeFact<T>` semantics instead of inventing a second certainty system. The context wrapper adds `id`, `key`, `perspective`, and optional related object/task ids.

Context activity entries are short, timestamped memory records. They are not a replacement for the event log. They are an object-local perspective summary of relevant activity.

## Scenario Definition V1

A scenario initializes the world. It may include:

- metadata: id, title, description, schema version
- active pack identifiers
- optional provider overrides keyed by pack id
- world setup: time, map center/viewport, environment values
- initial objects
- initial object contexts
- provider-specific simulator configuration keyed by pack id
- optional mission id/reference
- surface definition for initial client UI assembly

Scenarios should be shareable as JSON and validated before use. Scenarios are top-level compositions, not owned by a single pack. Packs are capabilities; scenarios are recipes that choose which capabilities are active.

Built-in scenarios use a compact Scenario Config as the authoring format. The config names active packs and describes pack-specific objects and operations with small JSON objects such as `pack: "ambulance", type: "incident"` or `pack: "traffic", type: "traffic_condition"`. Each pack owns the codec that expands those compact specs into validated `OperationalObject`s and applies pack-specific scenario operations. This keeps scenario files easy to inspect, edit, and generate while keeping domain object construction out of the scenario authoring layer.

Scenario Config expansion is deterministic and ordered. Initial objects are expanded in file order, and script actions are expanded in file order, because later objects/actions may legally reference objects created earlier. Do not parallelize scenario expansion across actions unless the spec gains an explicit dependency model.

Traffic condition configs may describe road-segment congestion by two route intent points (`from` and `to`) instead of a literal line. The traffic pack expands that intent through the active routing adapter into the same full geometry used by operator-created traffic. Literal geometry remains useful for areas and deliberately authored shapes, but route intent is preferred when the condition is meant to follow roads.

The expanded `ScenarioDefinition` remains the runtime contract. The Control Instance runtime does not execute JSON directly; it receives a validated definition with full operational objects and declarative script actions.

New control instances start from a validated Scenario Definition. Restored control instances start from persisted snapshots and durable history. Domain-specific seed factories are not a production startup mechanism; if a pack needs helper functions, they must produce full validated `OperationalObject`s inside a Scenario Definition rather than a parallel seed format.

Scenario startup is multi-pack and may become multi-provider. A scenario may activate several packs, for example ambulance plus traffic. The Scenario Catalog resolves each active pack to the pack's default simulation provider unless the scenario names an explicit provider override. The Simulation Hub receives the resolved provider ids and passes each provider only the initial objects and config relevant to that provider. This keeps scenario authoring centered on packs while preserving provider boundaries.

Simulation providers are responsible for rehydrating provider-private runtime mechanics from canonical objects when they connect. For example, the ambulance provider rebuilds active motion from an ambulance's tasking, position, target object, and route. If an active restored ambulance has tasking but no persisted route, the provider derives the missing route through the same routing adapter used for commands and scenario expansion before starting motion. This does not create a second source of truth: Leitbild's projected object state remains canonical, while the provider rebuilds private runtime state from it.

## Scenario Surface Definition V1

A Scenario Definition owns the initial client surface. The client must not render a hardcoded operational map, rail, or footer before a scenario surface has been loaded and validated.

The v1 surface model is deliberately narrow:

- `schemaVersion`: currently `1`.
- `regions`: configured instances of safe built-in primitives.
- `map`: MapLibre surface with explicit center, zoom, and enabled operational layer groups.
- `objectRail`: category rail with explicit category order, collapsed state, width, and visible field keys.
- `systemFooter`: status/version/theme/reset footer.
- `guidanceOverlay`: scenario-owned instructional overlay.

Surface Definitions are data contracts, not code. They may select from reviewed primitives and pass validated configuration into them. They may not import Svelte components, execute scripts, create arbitrary HTML, or silently rely on browser defaults.

Important v1 rules:

- A map region must provide its own center and zoom. Hidden default map viewports are not allowed.
- Object rail sections must reference categories contributed by active packs.
- Duplicate region ids and duplicate primitive regions are rejected.
- A scenario may omit the map or rail entirely if its surface does not need them.
- Rich adaptive/generated UI remains a future layer above this primitive registry and must treat generated specs as untrusted input.

This gives Leitbild a blank-slate boot path: open the control instance, load the scenario definition, validate the surface, then assemble only the declared primitives. Startup errors should be surfaced honestly in the boot modal.

## Scenario Script V1

A Scenario Definition may include an optional `script`. The script is a small declarative timeline, not an arbitrary code engine.

V1 supports steps scheduled relative to control-instance scenario start:

- `at: { kind: "after_scenario_start", seconds: number }`

Each step has an id, optional title, and one or more actions. Supported V1 actions:

- `show_guidance`: set canonical scenario guidance with title, message, related object ids, and dismissible flag.
- `hide_guidance`: clear current guidance, optionally only if the current guidance id matches.
- `highlight_objects`: set the current highlighted object ids.
- `clear_highlights`: clear all highlights or a named subset.
- `upsert_object`: commit a full operational object into projected state.
- `delete_object`: delete an operational object.

Compact Scenario Config may author `create_object` and `update_object` actions. These are expansion-time conveniences only: `create_object` becomes `upsert_object`, and `update_object` becomes `upsert_object` after the owning pack applies a declared operation such as `ambulance/set_incident_victims`. The runtime action vocabulary stays small.

Scenario script actions are committed as ordinary ordered Domain Events by the Control Instance runtime. This is deliberate:

- clients receive script changes over the same live feed as simulator and operator changes
- snapshots contain current guidance/highlights and evolved object state
- simulation providers observe committed object changes through the same provider projection mechanism
- event ordering stays under Control Instance ownership

Scenario scripts should be used for startup/tutorial flow, timed incidents, delayed fact revelation, and scenario-authored world changes. They should not contain general business logic, loops, arbitrary expressions, or domain rules. Domain mechanics such as ambulance patient loading or hospital admission remain in packs and interaction handlers.

Script progress is runtime state, not reusable scenario definition data. A Control Instance snapshot stores the scenario id, current guidance, highlighted object ids, and fired script step ids. This lets restored runtimes avoid refiring completed steps and fire overdue steps after restart.

## Mission Definition V1

A mission describes what should happen operationally. It may include:

- metadata: id, title, description, schema version
- briefing text
- goals: broad desired outcomes
- objectives: measurable conditions with success/failure/abort status
- tasks: assignable work for actors, objects, or roles
- stages: ordered or conditional mission phases
- triggers: small declarative conditions
- actions: limited declarative results of triggers/objective changes
- evaluation metrics: response time, time on scene, objective completion, workload-relevant measures

V1 should not support arbitrary script execution. Mission logic should be inspectable, validated, and testable.

## Trigger and Action Vocabulary

Start with a small set:

- object reaches target
- object enters zone
- task assigned
- task completed
- fact/context changed
- timer elapsed
- resource threshold crossed

Start with small actions:

- activate stage
- complete objective
- fail objective
- abort objective
- assign task
- append context activity
- raise alert

More can be added only when concrete scenarios need them.

## Mission Progress State

Mission progress is runtime state, separate from the mission definition. It tracks:

- active stages
- objective statuses
- task statuses
- fired triggers
- timestamps
- emitted mission events

Keeping progress separate makes mission definitions reusable and makes replay/debugging cleaner.

## Domain Interaction Rules

Some domain behavior is not a user command and not a generic Leitbild-core concern. Examples include an ambulance loading patients at an incident, a hospital accepting patients, a drone draining battery, or a ship loading cargo.

These behaviors should live inside the relevant pack. Leitbild core should not know ambulance-specific transfer rules, hospital admission rules, drone battery logic, or maritime cargo rules.

V1 rule pattern:

- objects carry data: capabilities, resources, load, capacity, status, context
- the simulation detects operational conditions such as arrival, proximity, timeout, threshold crossing, or assignment changes
- domain-local rule functions interpret object data and return explicit object upserts/deletes or other simulation events
- the simulation instance applies the results and emits ordered `SimulationEvent`s through the adapter

Objects should not contain executable behavior. An ambulance object should not directly mutate an incident, and a hospital object should not directly mutate an ambulance. Instead, the ambulance pack can define deterministic interaction helpers such as "empty ambulance arrived at incident" or "loaded ambulance arrived at hospital".

Any object type can be the source or subject of a domain event. For example, a hospital can report that no emergency beds are available, or an incident can report updated victim information. The object does not emit directly onto Leitbild's event stream; the simulation instance emits the event with provenance that identifies the simulator, object, and cause. This keeps event ordering, replay, persistence, and remote simulator integration coherent.

Generalization to a core rule engine is deferred until at least two real domain packs need the same abstraction.

## Agent Context View

An agent context view is derived on demand. It should contain:

- object identity and current operational state
- current mission/task assignment
- important context facts
- recent relevant activity
- concise summaries
- relevant nearby or linked objects by summary/reference
- allowed command/action affordances

The view should be bounded. Do not pass entire event logs, entire object graphs, or unfiltered raw context to LLMs.

## Options Considered

### Put everything into `domainData`

Rejected. Domain data should remain domain operational truth. Mixing perspective and memory into it would make replay, validation, and UI behavior ambiguous.

### Rename `domainData` to `domainState`

Deferred. The name may be clearer eventually, but current code and tests already use `domainData`. Renaming while adding context would make this change larger and riskier.

### Use `SituationModel` as the field name

Rejected for the concrete object field. It is conceptually accurate but too abstract. `context` is shorter and more natural for LLM handoff.

### Store agent prompts or full LLM context in objects

Rejected. Agent context views must be derived, bounded, and disposable. Persisted object context should remain structured data, not prompt text.

### Build a general mission scripting engine

Rejected for v1. It would be powerful but hard to validate, inspect, and test. Leitbild should start with a small declarative trigger/action vocabulary.

## Architectural Rules

- `domainData` and `context` must not be blurred.
- Context must be structured, not a generic junk drawer.
- Context is optional; existing snapshots remain valid.
- Mission definitions are reusable data; mission progress is runtime state.
- Agent context views are derived and must not become canonical state.
- Scenario and mission definitions must validate at file/API boundaries before execution.
- Domain interaction rules live in packs and must produce explicit events or object changes.
- Operational objects are data, not active executable actors.
